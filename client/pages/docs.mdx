<h2 className={styles.heading}> Markdown Support </h2>{" "}

This site has support for Markdown for some special things like `About Me`,`Description` of a Posting,`Description` of an Offer. But you can't use all the features of the Markdown because I am too lazy to implement all of them.
Supported Features are:-

    - emoji
    - tables
    - underline
    - images
    - headings
    - lists
    - marquee tag
    - code tag

<h2 className={styles.heading}> Sharing</h2>{" "}

You can share some of the urls directly to others and they'll view the same content like `/<your username>` route and `/<your username>/<title>` to show a specific posting.
